# Semantic-Diffraction-in-Conceptual-Graphs
A Structural Approach to Equilibrium and Synthesis Detection. Semantic graph auditor based on Personalized PageRank (PPR) for IA_m. Analyzes concept pairs to detect structural equilibria, stability (ratio/balance), drift, and emergent synthesis using axis-based role filtering, structure/mixed modes, and an axis-guided refine pass.
